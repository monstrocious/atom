The variables are `@syntax-color-added`, `@syntax-color-removed`, and `@syntax-color-modified`. Make sure your theme defines these, so it is compatible with this package!\n\nTo override these colors in your `styles.less`, write selectors for `.minimap .added`, `.minimap .removed`, and/or `.minimap .selected`. For instance:\n\n```\n.minimap .added {\n  background: blue !important;\n}\n```\n\n### Notes\n\nBoth the Split Diff and Minimap packages must also be installed and enabled in Atom for this package to work.\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/mupchrch/minimap-split-diff/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/mupchrch/minimap-split-diff#readme","_id":"minimap-split-diff@0.3.7","_shasum":"2d0c3bec610422069f976fd12798a3b549224e9b","_resolved":"file:../d-117229-73045-aar8tb/package.tgz","_from":"../d-117229-73045-aar8tb/package.tgz"}
